It will provide real-time analysis, pinpoint slow-loading resources, categorize performance issues, and offer actionable optimization suggestions, all presented in a user-friendly interface. This is intended to be a fully featured, final product, not an MVP.

1.2 Goals:

Empower Users: Provide users with immediate, actionable insights into website performance issues without requiring deep expertise in web performance analysis tools.

Increase Efficiency: Streamline the process of identifying performance bottlenecks, saving developers and performance engineers valuable time.

Improve Web Performance: Ultimately contribute to faster, more efficient websites by making performance optimization more accessible and understandable.

Comprehensive Analysis: Cover a wide range of performance metrics and bottleneck categories.

User-Friendly Experience: Offer an intuitive and easy-to-understand interface within the browser.

Reliable and Accurate: Provide accurate performance data and relevant optimization suggestions.

Maintainable and Extensible: Design a modular and well-structured codebase for future updates and feature additions.

2. Target Audience

Web Developers (Front-end & Back-end): To debug and optimize website performance during development and testing.

Performance Engineers: To quickly analyze and diagnose performance issues in live websites.

Quality Assurance (QA) Testers: To identify performance regressions and issues during testing phases.

Bottleneck Identification & Categorization: Intelligently analyze the waterfall chart and performance metrics to identify potential performance bottlenecks.

Categorize Bottlenecks: Group identified bottlenecks into categories:

Network Latency: Issues related to network connection speed and server response times (high TTFB, slow DNS lookup).

Server Performance: Server-side processing delays.

Resource Size: Large file sizes (images, scripts, CSS).

Prioritize Bottlenecks: Rank bottlenecks based on their estimated impact on page load performance.

3.2 Optimization Suggestions & Guidance

Actionable Suggestions: Provide specific, actionable suggestions for resolving identified bottlenecks. Suggestions should be context-aware and tailored to the specific bottleneck category and resource.

Examples of Suggestions:

Network Latency: "Consider using a CDN," "Optimize server location," "Reduce DNS lookup time."

Resource Size (Images): "Compress images using [recommended tools/techniques]," "Use responsive images," "Lazy load images."

Resource Size (Scripts/CSS): "Minify and compress JavaScript and CSS files," "Remove unused CSS," "Code splitting for JavaScript."

Blocking Resources: "Defer loading of non-critical JavaScript," "Inline critical CSS," "Use <link rel='preload'> for critical resources."

Unoptimized Images: "Use WebP format for images," "Optimize image compression levels," "Resize images to appropriate dimensions."

Inefficient JavaScript: "Profile JavaScript code to identify slow functions," "Optimize JavaScript algorithms," "Reduce main thread blocking."

Unoptimized CSS: "Remove duplicate CSS rules," "Optimize CSS selectors," "Use CSS frameworks efficiently."

Font Loading Issues: "Use font-display: swap," "Preload font files," "Host fonts locally."

Third-Party Scripts: "Evaluate the necessity of third-party scripts," "Load third-party scripts asynchronously," "Defer loading of non-essential third-party scripts."

Links to Documentation & Resources: Provide links to relevant web performance documentation (e.g., MDN Web Docs, web.dev) and optimization tools for each suggestion.

Severity Level Indication: Indicate the severity level of each bottleneck (e.g., high, medium, low impact) to help users prioritize optimization efforts.

3.3 User Interface (UI) & User Experience (UX)

5. Non-Functional Requirements

Performance: The extension itself must have minimal impact on browser and webpage performance. Analysis should be efficient and non-blocking.

Security: The extension must be secure and not introduce any security vulnerabilities. Data handling should be secure and private. No collection of user browsing data without explicit consent (if any data collection is ever considered in future, it's currently not planned).

Privacy: User privacy is paramount. The extension should not collect or transmit any user browsing history or personal data without explicit consent and clear privacy policy (which is not intended for version 1.0). Data processing should happen locally within the browser.

Reliability: The extension should be reliable and function correctly across different websites and browser versions.

Usability: The extension should be user-friendly, intuitive, and easy to use for the target audience.

Accessibility: The UI should be designed with accessibility in mind, following WCAG guidelines where applicable.

Maintainability: The codebase should be well-structured, modular, and documented for easy maintenance and future updates.

Extensibility: The modular architecture should allow for easy addition of new features and performance analysis capabilities in future versions.

Localization: Consider future localization to support multiple languages.

6. Success Metrics

User Adoption Rate: Number of active users of the extension.

User Engagement: Frequency of extension usage, time spent using the extension.

User Satisfaction: User reviews, ratings, and feedback (e.g., through extension store reviews, feedback forms).

Website Performance Improvement (Indirect): Track the general trend of website performance metrics over time, though directly attributing this to the extension is challenging.

Bug Reports & Issue Resolution Time: Minimize bug reports and ensure timely resolution of reported issues.

Feature Request Volume: Monitor user feature requests to guide future development.

7. Release Criteria

All core features listed in Section 3 are implemented and tested.

All non-functional requirements in Section 5 are met.

Comprehensive testing across target browsers and websites is completed.

User documentation and help resources are available.

Extension is packaged and ready for distribution on browser extension stores (Chrome Web Store, Firefox Add-ons, Edge Add-ons).

8. Future Considerations (Beyond Version 1.0 - for Product Roadmap)

Advanced Bottleneck Analysis: Implement more sophisticated bottleneck detection algorithms, potentially using machine learning to identify patterns and predict performance issues.

Performance Budgeting & Alerts: Allow users to set performance budgets and receive alerts when websites exceed these budgets.

Integration with Performance Monitoring Tools: Integrate with external website performance monitoring services (e.g., Google PageSpeed Insights, WebPageTest) to provide even richer analysis and data.

Cloud-Based Data Storage (Optional & with User Consent): Optionally allow users to store and compare performance analysis data across different websites and over time (with explicit user consent and focus on privacy).

Automated Optimization Suggestions Implementation: Explore the possibility of automatically applying some optimization suggestions (e.g., image compression) with user confirmation.

Community Features: Explore features for sharing performance analysis results and optimization strategies within a community of developers.

Expanded Browser Support: Extend support to other browsers if feasible and demanded by users.

This Product Requirements Document serves as a guide for the development of the "Performance Insights" browser extension. It will be reviewed and updated as needed throughout the development lifecycle.
