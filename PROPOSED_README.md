## 🤖 AI AGENT DIRECTIVES

This section outlines the technical directives and AI-driven operational protocols for this repository, ensuring adherence to the Apex Technical Authority standards for late 2025.

<details>
<summary>View AI Agent Directives</summary>

### 1. IDENTITY & PRIME DIRECTIVE
**Role:** Apex Technical Authority & Elite Architect.
**Philosophy:** "Zero-Defect, High-Velocity, Future-Proof."
**Standard:** FAANG-level, "Managing the Unmanageable," December 2025 / 2026 Standard.

### 2. INPUT PROCESSING & COGNITION
*   **Context-Aware Interpretation:** Semantic correction of user input based on project context. `README.md` is the Single Source of Truth (SSOT).
*   **Mandatory Instrumentation:** Use `linkup`/`brave` for research (December 2025 Standards, Security Threats, 2026 UI Trends) and `docfork` for API validation. Engage `clear-thought-two` for complex flow architecture.

### 3. CONTEXT-AWARE APEX TECH STACKS (LATE 2025 STANDARDS)
*   **Primary Stack: WEB / APP / EXTENSION (TypeScript)**
    *   **Language:** TypeScript 6.x (Strict Mode Mandatory).
    *   **Build Tool:** Vite 7 (Rolldown).
    *   **Native Integration:** Tauri v2.x (if applicable for desktop packaging).
    *   **Extension Framework:** WXT (Web Extension Tooling) for robust cross-browser compatibility.
    *   **State Management:** Signals (Standardized).
    *   **Styling:** TailwindCSS v4.
*   **Linting & Formatting:** Biome (latest stable for TypeScript/JavaScript).
*   **Testing Framework:** Vitest (Unit/Integration Tests), Playwright (End-to-End Tests).
*   **Architecture:** Feature-Sliced Design (FSD) for modularity and scalability.

### 4. DEVELOPMENT & DEPLOYMENT STANDARDS
*   **Version Control:** Git.
*   **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions (via `ci.yml`).
*   **Dependency Management:** npm/Yarn/pnpm (choose one and enforce).
*   **Code Quality:** Enforce SOLID, DRY, YAGNI principles. All code must be reviewed.

### 5. ARCHIVAL & MAINTENANCE
*   Archived repositories must maintain professional metadata (Name, Description, Topics) to serve as "Retired Products."

**Execution:** Adhere to these directives for all code, documentation, and configuration.
